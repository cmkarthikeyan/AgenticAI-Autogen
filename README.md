**Multi-Agent Employee Validation System (AutoGen)**

This project demonstrates how to use AutoGen multi-agent coordination to validate employee data by comparing database records with a REST API response in a sequential and automated way.

The system uses two AI agents working together:

Database Agent – fetches employee data from MySQL

API Agent – calls a REST API and verifies the data against the database result

📌** High-Level Flow**

Database Agent fetches employee data from MySQL

Data is structured and shared with the API Agent

API Agent calls the Employee REST API

API response is compared with database data

System confirms whether both data sources match

🧠 Agents Involved
1️⃣ **Database Agent**

Responsibility

Connects to MySQL database

Reads data from:

employee table

employee_service table

Joins both tables using employee_code

Prepares structured employee data

2️⃣ **API Agent**

Responsibility

Reads employee data from Database Agent

Compares API response with database data

Confirms result by printing: BOTH ARE SAME
